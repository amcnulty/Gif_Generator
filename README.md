A gif generator that leverages the Giphy API. This is for week 6 homework of the coding bootcamp.

## Giphy API
This game makes use of the Giphy API to generate gifs. This is a free api and I have provided a link to the documentation in the description.

## Objectives
1. Create a gif generator for the browser.
2. Acquire gifs from the Giphy API.
3. Create a list of buttons that are dynamically created from an array of topics.
4. When gifs are clicked on they should toggle between animated and still.
5. Display the rating of the gif under each image.
6. Allow users to create their own topics with a form on the page.
